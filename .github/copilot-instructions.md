# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- User expects me to build the project from the repository root without asking for confirmation when already in the repo root.
- Project standards from `dev/DIRECTIVES.md` and `dev/PROMPT.md` must be followed, including performance, security, async handling, XML documentation, testing, changelog maintenance, and project structure.
- Rename test file `UnitTest1.cs` to `ErrorKitTests.cs` before publishing; class name already correct.
